Hey there!

It’s been long since I last wrote. A lot of things piled up and I didn’t get time to be consistent at all, but I will try to be now onwards. Class 11 annual exams in Feb and the sudden demise of my grandfather in the same month, then coping up with class 12th and FIITJEE kept me busy for the past few months. So, what brought me back to life online? I am going to Japan tomorrow and I wanted to document the smallest details of the trip so I write. 

It’s a scholarship-based trip under the Sakura Science Plan by the Japan Government. A one-week trip where we’ll be staying in Hiroshima for 3 days and the rest in Tokyo. The flight is at about 1 A.M. I am very excited and pumped up. Although I had been attending classes today from 8 AM to 6 PM, there is no sign of being tired at all. Also, the fact that I woke up at 5 AM today after sleeping at 12 AM. Seems like it will be quite some time until the next sleep. 

This is going to be an amazing experience, we’ll be witnessing some of the best technological advancements in various fields done by Japan and of course, we’re going to learn a lot. Even the smallest of experiences and encounters sometimes carry something big to teach you. So, I look forward to a wonderful experience in Japan, and on a shorter note, a nice flight.

I will be posting daily so stay connected! 

Peace.
