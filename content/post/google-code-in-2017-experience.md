30 days, 140+ hours of hard work, many sleepless nights, a lot of missed classes in school and a hell lot of excitement, that is how I can sum up my Google Code-In (GCI) experience for you. Let me tell you, this article itself took 6+ hours to compile and write. Enjoy reading...

# About me

For all those who don't know me, I am Adhyan Dhull, a 16 year old tech enthusiast from India with a little knowledge of code, a blogger and an open source contributor(thanks to SCoRe and GCI). I am also an avid Physics enthusiast especially in the field of Quantum Mechanics. There is one thing peculiar about me: I do everything up to perfection. I am in Grade 11 and currently enrolled in [Delhi Public School, Sonepat](https://dps.in). I am currently the Head-Boy and lead the Executive Body at my school. I am also a good speaker, I often give presentations and stuff...

# The Beginning

I got to know about Google Code-In from my school's Computer Science teacher Mr. Prabhuji Gupta. Shout out to him as if he wouldn't have  I could not have come this far in the competition. It was 18th December 2017 when it all started and I completed my first task, I was quite late as the competition had already started on 28th November 2017. My sole purpose of enrolling for the competition was to expand my knowledge and start contributing to open source programs. 

# Choosing an Organisation

The first thing you do once you have registered is to choose an organization for which you want to work with and do tasks for. At first, I had a little difficulty in choosing the right organization I stumbled across a few organizations but then settled for one - SCoRe. 

Let me tell you a bit about the Organisation - SCoRe,  Sustainable Computing Research Group at University of Colombo School of Computing is a research group that seeks sustainable solutions for various problems developing countries like Sri Lanka. 

The moment I saw tasks from SCoRe, I figured out they were quite do-able and good quality of tasks to start with. This is where the biggest turn comes in my GCI experience, working with SCoRe completely changed my perception of Google Code-In. The tasks from SCoRe were such well organized that even an inexperienced like me could figure out a way from easy tasks to a bit tough ones. SCoRe opened me to the new world of Open-Source and I would never like to exit it again, I'll keep contributing to the numerous projects under SCoRe Lab.

# Why Open Source?

Wait, you would be thinking - Why does Google Code-In give emphasis on Open-Source? I would just say a line "Open-Source is the future of all programs", It already has set many milestones and much more to go.

# The Blog: [gci2017experience.ml](https://gci2017experience.ml)

I created this blog as to provide the upcoming SCoRe or even GCI enthusiasts with a platform of complete experience. I also had to devote time to this blog other than doing GCI tasks but it always helps, I feel happy I would be able to provide others the help I could not get, so do share the blog for others to read.

# An insight of what all I did in this iteration of Google Code-In

## Bassa :

This was one of the most intriguing projects I worked on, and I put a lot of time setting it up. I definitely learned a lot, most important being - shift to any Linux distro in case you want to regularly contribute to open source. I have also now installed Ubuntu 17.10.1 on my machine as I would like to continue contributing to more such awesome projects. I had some problems setting up Bassa in Windows but with the impeccable guides and a lot of useful help from my mentors, I could finally set it up. I also created a complete video tutorial and screencast on how to setup Bassa on a Windows machine (I recently got to know from a few students that my video helped a lot). I also created a detailed description troubleshooting some problems faced and submitted it as an issue. In addition to that, I created an issue and pull request to update the .gitignore file. I also learned a lot about using Python as a backend and also learned how to communicate with SQL using Python. 

I have also written an article on Bassa. Check it out [here](http://www.gci2017experience.ml/2018/01/bassa-automated-download-queue.html). Also [here](https://youtu.be/QAQaThaUOgE) is the link to my YouTube video on "How to  Setup Bassa"

## GoCloud :

Okay, so this was another project which quite grabbed my attention and drew me to work on it. I first came across this mastermind project when I saw a task of research about the trending cloud providers. I started to then read about different cloud providers and their API implementations, honestly, it was fun researching, then I created a detailed issue as a report to my research. I also suggested changes in the Wiki and created a PR for corrections in the ReadMe file. 

In addition, I wrote a blog on GoCloud [here](http://www.gci2017experience.ml/2018/01/gocloud-cloud-services-library-for-go.html) and on "How to Set-up GoCloud" [here](http://www.gci2017experience.ml/2018/01/gocloud-how-to-set-it-up.html). I created the Architecture Diagram for GoCloud which reflected the functionality of GoCloud at a glance and was appreciated by my mentor too. 

Next is the most interesting part of my working with SCoRe Lab, I conducted a session on GoCloud in my school. YouTube video for same can be found [here](https://youtu.be/dx8_lcbsb8c). The students were intrigued by the presentation and they cleared all their doubts regarding GoCloud with me. They asked many questions regarding the working and functioning of such services and I was happy to answer them all from my knowledge and research on GoCloud and service providers. Overall, it was wonderful to work on GoCloud.

Here is the Architecture Diagram I created for GoCloud:
