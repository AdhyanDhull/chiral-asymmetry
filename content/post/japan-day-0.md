A hilarious incident happened last night. We were given our room keys and were told to be careful at all times when leaving the room so that the key isn’t left inside. This was what happened yesterday with me, I came out of the room to help our supervisor with the Wi-Fi router settings and I absent mindedly left the key inside. A lot went through my mind at that time, but it is one of my first experience where I found how helpful and cooperative Japanese people are. Lesson learnt!

Coming to today, what an amazing day it was. The day commenced with the beautiful balcony view and me waking up at 5 AM without any alarms, haha. So, I dressed up and headed outside the building just to roam around and get a hang of the place. I soon was joined by some friends and so the pictures below. 

This is the balcony view from my room on the 6th floor.

Below is our the JICA Chugoku International Center.

Then at around 7 AM, we reported for the breakfast and soon were off to Hiroshima University High School. I was really excited for this as this would be a school exchange experience. Architecture was one thing which always fascinated me and here in Japan, It couldn’t get any better. The school had a brilliant architecture. Upon reaching there we had a small introduction to schooling in Japan and later the Principal Mr. Takemura addressed us and advised us to make the best of this opportunity. We were divided into groups of 4, two Indians and two Japanese high school students. We got some free time to talk with our partners and learn more about them; it was great interacting with them. We exchanged our views on each other’s cultures, music preferences, and what not. 

Shortly after we attended a typical Japanese High-School Year 2 Physics Class. This was a major eye opener for me, we all had heard of how education is practical abroad but experiencing it is totally a wonderful experience. We discussed about sustainable development, resource management and how solar energy is the best renewable source of energy, studied about the Voltage vs Current graphs for solar cells and their non-ohmic behaviour. We also discussed the Shockley Diode Equation for current densities. Then we conducted an experiment with small solar panel, took readings and plotted a graph noticing the behavior of solar cells and highlighting the maximum power generation. It was an eye-opening experience, at the same time a great learning opportunity too. 

After the first class we had a break along with other students, we ate our lunch and then went on to roam around the school premises in the free time. Next up was the thing I had grown even more excitement for by then -  Maths class. We were taught parities in the class and then given an assignment to do on the basis of concepts taught. This was a group assignment so if one person solves the problem, he/she needs to explain it to the group improving the communications skills and encouraging teamwork. There were a total of 10 questions and we could mark on the board as soon as the whole group knows the solution. Our team was Team 8 and we named ourselves the “Euler’s Team”. I wish we had a more punny name, “Math πrates” would have been something cool, but it didn’t strike anyone of us xP. Anyways, we shared our Winner’s title with other team for solving 8 questions. It took me a while of observation and a different thought process to get solving the problems, once in the rhythm I solved 5 consecutive questions for our team. I was surprised by the drastic change in the teaching methodology, I felt it is more application based in Japan.

Let me give you an example.

Information provided by the teacher under topic “Parities”:

```
odd + odd = even		(sum of two odd numbers is an even number)

even + even = even		(sum of two even numbers is an even number)

odd + even = odd		(sum of an even and an odd number is an odd number)

odd * odd = odd		(product of two odd numbers is another odd number)

odd * even = even		(product of an odd and an even number is an even number)
```

Problem based upon the information provided:

```
Pete brought a notebook containing 96 pages and numbered them from 1 to 192 in order. Victor tore out 25 pages of Pete’s notebook and added the 50 numbers he found on the pages. Could Victor have gotten 1990 as the sum?
```

 Solution 

```
No. The explanation is as below:
```

```
If Pete numbered 96 pages from 1 to 192, that means there are two consecutive numbers on each page and hence their sum will be odd as one of them will be an odd number and other an even number. Now if we sum 25 odd numbers, we will get another odd number but, 1990 is even. So, it’s impossible for the sum to be 1990.
```

I hope the example exhibited the application-based approach of Japanese teaching. 

After the class we had the closing ceremony, I was lucky to get an opportunity to thank the school and authorities for giving us this opportunity and making this possible. I expressed my gratitude to my level best, it was a wonderful experience to be at Hiroshima University High School.

And it just seems I am over for the day, but I am not. We had another wonderful visit in the evening. It was Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum. We all know about the Hiroshima and Nagasaki atom-bomb droppings, the museum stood as a collection of various items from the past. The very proof of progress of Japan, Hiroshima to be precise is an example for the rest of the world. The Museum showcased various items from 1945 and various pictures of how much destruction was caused, how did the radioactive substances decayed and contaminated the environment and caused genetic mutations for generations. The working of an atom bomb was also displayed, the epicenter of the bomb was about 1200 m away from the museum. We walked to there, it is known as the Atom Bomb Dome, the bomb detonated 600 meters above the restructured dome shown in the picture below. Detonating the bomb at this height had only one motive, to increase the range of the bomb to cause maximum destruction. The very thought of people and all other stuff vaporizing gives me chills.

The view from outisde the Museum, a symbol of development and progress.

We then also walked to the market, the first experience for us. Then we had dinner in an Indian Restaurant, the owner was Indian and shifted here sometime ago. He was really humble, served us “kheer” himself and had a good talk with us all.

Altogether, it was an amazing day. The first impression of Japan couldn’t get any better. We all have high expectations for the days to come. 

Thank you for reading!

Peace.
