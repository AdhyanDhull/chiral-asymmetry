It had been a long journey but I was surprised by the fact that none of us was tired, it was due to the excitement probably. We boarded our plane at 12:55 am today from Indira Gandhi International Airport, Delhi heading towards Narita International Airport, Tokyo. We landed in Narita at 12:30 pm, although it was a long flight but it was a nice and comfortable. Most of the students grabbed some nice sleep, but I guess the excitement kept me awake. The sunrise was one amazing thing to witness, from high above the clouds it was a mesmerizing sight. I was too busy enjoying the moment that the idea of capturing skipped my mind. 

A few minutes before the landing, I was amazed to see the lush greenery outside from the small, curved plane-window. The very idea of Japan in our minds was a busy country full of sky-scrapers, but it was so different and even better than our expectations. After completing the immigration check and collecting our baggage, we were received by Sakura Science Plan Coordinators and helpers. We received our SSP Id-Cards and baggage tags. We then were taken to the lounge on Narita Airport and we attended the program orientation there. The orientation comprised of the trip details and basic information, from normal etiquettes to emergency scenarios. The orientation was followed by a quick lunch and we left for boarding our domestic flight to Hiroshima Airport. 

We boarded the two winged, ANA Bombardier JA846A. It was a small yet powerful beast. I felt the difference in the two take-offs we had today.

The flight was short but the wonderful view kept almost everyone from using the in-flight entertainment. We saw Mount Fuji on our way, and later the sunset, ‘beautiful’ won’t even justify the view. 



After about one and half an hour we reached Hiroshima, we were heartily welcomed by the Program members and coordinators. What followed was the most exciting part at least for me, stepping out of the Airport door. It was dark outside, and wind gushes past me. One of the best feelings, I could feel the change in the very air after all the air condition in Delhi and nearby areas is too poor. The moment I stepped out of that door, I could feel Japan, and I delved into this never ending green madness till the extent of my sight. 

Our accommodation, JICA Chugoku International Center was half an hour from the airport, we had dinner on our way. We were given keys to our individual rooms and given the instruction manuals. So, everyone headed for their rooms with their luggage. I kept my luggage and roamed around. 



The room is quite spacious and well furnished, there is a small balcony and the view was really nice. Now I just sit on the bed typing this to document this trip. Big day tomorrow, will have a School Exchange and then visit the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum. 

Thanks for reading!

Peace.
