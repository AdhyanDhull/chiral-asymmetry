Cheers! I am a Google Code-In finalist for SCoRe Organization. The results were declared yesterday i.e. 31st Jan 2018 at 22:30 IST.

Well it was not quite a surprise as we had already received an email regarding the same on 25th Jan 2018. I wanted to eagerly tell you all but Google asked us to keep it a secret until yesterday ;)

My heartiest congratulations to all the winners from all organisations!!

I sincerely thank all the mentors from SCoRe for their co-operation and help throughout the event. It was amazing to work with you all and I look forward to keep contributing to various projects.

I'd also like to thank Mr. Prabhuji Gupta for letting me know about this competition, Our Pro-Vice Chair Person Mrs. R. Mann, Headmaster Mr. Rajeev Singh and Director Mrs. Sudesh Singh for believing in me and always being supportive. It is due to the school that provided my fellow schoolmates and me a platform to learn and explore various fields whether it be Computer Science or Sports.

The prizes that I'll receive include a GCI Hoodie, a GCI T-shirt, Digital certificate and some more goodies :)

I hope my achievement inspires my juniors from the school and they make it big in the upcoming years too.

Here's the screenshot from the Google Code-In Winners Page.

I also received an email from Google for my Award Letter and Certificate. Kudos to the Google Open Source team to organize such a great event and providing us a platform to compete and interact with students and mentors form all over the globe.  It was great to be a part of GCI 2017 :)
