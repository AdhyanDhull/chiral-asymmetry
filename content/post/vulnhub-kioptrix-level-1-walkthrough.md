Today I tried another vulnerable machine which can be found at <https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/kioptrix-level-1-1,22/> and is often the beginner’s first choice for an OSCP lab type environment.

This is how the vulnerable machine looks like in VMware

![null](/images/uploads/aa-1-.png)

Now I started with discovering the target IP on the discover-able network, but I couldn’t find anything other than the default gateway and broadcast IP addresses.

After changing the network settings in VMware from Bridged to NAT, I tried rebooting and still couldn’t discover the machine, I checked again and figured out the machine was configured to start in Bridged mode only.

After doing some research I found a simple available solution, I just had to edit the **_.vmx_** file and change a few defaults.

The highlighted parts are changed from “**_Bridged_**” to “**_NAT_**” or “**_bridged_**” to “**_nat_**”

Now upon running the **_arp-scan_** command again, I could successfully discover the target IP address and this solved the issue.

`arp-scan –l`	or 	`netdiscover –i eth0`

Now that we know the IP address of the target machine is **_192.168.192.132_**, we can do enumeration on the target.

We start with Network-Mapper to do the port scanning and scavenge all the services running on all/most important ports.

`nmap –A –Pn <target IP address>`

Below is the complete output highlighting the ports and services running on them:

```

```

Now that the port scanning is done, we will try to see if we can find vulnerabilities in the services running on these ports using <https://exploit-db.com> or searchscploit tool or metasploit framework in KALI.

As I saw HTTP and HTTPS is working on their default ports only, I tried accessing the probable webpages on the server hosting but there was nothing except the page below and a link which seemed intriguing

![null](/images/uploads/aa-6-.png)

Clicking on the _**DocumentRoot **_hyperlink, I am forwarded to a 404 page, but it gives me away two of the directory names, upon further inspection I find nothing of use there.

Now that I’ve checked **_port 80 and 443_**, I checked and found that**_ SSH login_** wasn’t working. The only two interesting services I could try to find exploits for were, **_rpcbind on port 111 and Samba on port 139._**

Now after some research I found out that open _**rpcbind **_port can be used for Denial of Service attacks only, so I then came to Samba. Using a script in Metasploit framework, to determine the _**Samba version**_ being used on the target machine I wrote the following commands:

`msfconsole`

`use auxiliary/scanner/smb/smb_version`

`show options`

`set RHOSTS <target IP>`

`exploit`

![null](/images/uploads/aa-9-.png)

Now from this I concluded that the version of Samba that is being used here is **_2.2.1a_**, and searched for an exploit on <https://exploit-db.com> and the search parameter being “**_samba 2.2.x_**” 

![null](/images/uploads/aa-10-.png)

Using this I tried a few exploits present here and I got my first success from the highlighted exploit, so I’ll just show how to use it here.

First of all I’ll download the exploit from the exploit, this can be done manually or using terminal

`wget <file url>` 

Now the file I downloaded was named “**_22469.c_**”

We now have to compile the exploit to be executable using

`gcc –o <output filename> <exploit code filename>`

To execute it, we simply use 

`./<executable name>`

![null](/images/uploads/aa-11-.png)

Now this exploit needs some parameters to function and attack the correct target,

`./samba-exploit –t <target address>`

![null](/images/uploads/aa-12-.png)

This directly gave us root access, and boom we’re in. I also rechecked, using the linux commands `whoami` and `id`.

Congratulations, we have successfully completed the walk-through, I hope you enjoyed it, regarding any doubts, I can be contacted via the contact information available on the blog.
