I woke up pretty early today morning, around 4 o’clock. I was ready by about 4:30 AM, looked out of the balcony to find it was a wonderful morning indeed. I packed my bag for the day and went down stairs to roam around the plaza we were staying in. What a magnificent view it was in the surroundings, after roaming for about an hour, I sat down on of the benches laid there and read a book. It was so peaceful and calm in the morning, I could feel the very serenity in nature. 

There’s one thing I realized today sitting there, it is very important to maintain a balance for everything in life, just like Japan has had various technological advancements and development, it has also taken good care of the environment, the flora and fauna. We all need to take it as an example and look forward to a well-balanced life. We had breakfast at about 7:40 AM, so I had some good time to roam around and was joined with other friends by 7 o’clock as they were up a bit early too. Now if you are curious, for breakfast we had a buffet. I won’t be able to name all of the food items, but some of the most common and preferred ones were potato fries, scrambled eggs, rice/miso soup, bread, butter/jam, fruit juices, coffee, and a whole variety of other stuff including some Japanese food items too. Soon after the breakfast, we were off to Energia Research Institute, Chugoku Electric Power Co. Inc.

We had an orientation followed by a few lectures upon reaching there, the presentations discussed about how Japan has shifted to non-renewable sources of energy and how that helps in sustainable development and also what role the Energia Research Institute plays in it. One slide also showed a recent comparison of energy producing patterns in Japan and India, they were somewhat similar but where India created a large portion of their electricity by burning coal in thermal power plants, Japan opted for natural gas. Other non-renewable energy sources like solar power, wind power, geothermal power and hydropower account for a good share in Japan and a little less of a share in India.

After the orientation, we went on a tour around the Research Institute, we discovered various new advances in electricity production also how various technologies were used to generate a higher electric yield. We were also told that a major percentage of the Institute’s electricity comes from the gigantic Solar Panels in the park outside the main building. On the end of the tour, we talked about the prevalence of electric vehicles in Japan. I gotta say, its been hardly two days for us in Japan but we have seen that a large percentage of cars here are electric. Coming back to the Institute, they even had arranged an electric car for us to learn more. Unfortunately, it started raining at about the same time so we had to cut short the tour. 

During the journey to our lunch venue, I realized Japan is all the more beautiful when it rains. After the lunch we headed towards Hiroshima University. I was pretty excited as I was looking forward to learning about various opportunities of study in Japan and the difference in courses or the course planning. We were given a brief University Introduction and the various programs it has to offer to International students. The main highlight of the university for us was the Department of Integrated Global Studies and the variety of programs taught at Hiroshima University in English. There were some factual figures too, Hiroshima University ranks 10th in Japan and is a National University. 

Another interesting part was that we got the opportunity to talk to two Indian students already studying in Hiroshima University. We cleared our doubts ranging from living outside campus, to differences they felt between Indian system and Japanese system, costs, food, normal lifestyle and interactions with other people. We then attended a lecture about Bio-diversity and its importance, how species have been going extinct recently the most popular being One-horned Rhinoceros, discussing the various reasons of a tremendous increase in rate of extinctions. Soon after that we visited their Chemistry lab and observed other students performing various experiments, we had little interaction with the students. Then, a professor and two of his students exhibited a few experiments based on surface tension, it was amazing to see the experiments and learn about different phenomenon side by side. Although we had learned about it in Class 11 but there is much more to learn other than just formulas and derivations, I believe learning starts with experiencing.

I discovered some while ago that there is a fun/playing area in the plaza too. We played badminton, darts, and pool there. Also, there was a whole separate room of instruments, I tried my hand at the piano which I once learned about 5-6 years ago. During all of this, I made new friends and got to know them. 

Another hilarious yet kinda scary incident happened late tonight, just about half an hour ago. The fire alarms of the building started beeping, as if something was on fire. We all came down to the ground floor and upon a thorough check by the staff, it was made clear that it was a false alarm. Everyone is relieved and I guess sleeping peacefully by now because its 11:54 PM.

Summing up, it was a wonderful day. Gonna wake up early tomorrow as we’ll be flying to Tokyo in morning.

Thanks for reading!

Peace.
