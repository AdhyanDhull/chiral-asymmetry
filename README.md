# Chiral Asymmetry

This is my new personal blog and will be working at [blog.adhyandhull.me](https://blog.adhyandhull.me). I'll be sharing the things I do or my opinions on recent news/technologies I come across.

## Technologies Used
- [Netlify CMS](https://www.netlifycms.org/)
- [Hugo](http://gohugo.io/)

## Theme Used
[Tranquilpeak theme](https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-tranquilpeak-theme/) for Hugo.

### Theme Credits
*Hugo* version of Tranquilpeak is a based on original [*Hexo* version](https://github.com/LouisBarranqueiro/hexo-theme-tranquilpeak). This version is simply a port to *Hugo* static site generator. The port was done by [kakawait](https://github.com/kakawait).

Please all the credit should be attributed to [original *Hexo* version](https://github.com/LouisBarranqueiro/hexo-theme-tranquilpeak) and its author [Louis Barranqueiro](https://github.com/LouisBarranqueiro).

### Boilerplate Credits
The boilerplate codes here have been used from [The-Ragasirtahk-Blog](https://github.com/ragasirtahk/The-ragasirtahk-Blog) Repository

## Setup for Yourself
My friend [Sagar Khatri](https://github.com/ragasirtahk) has created a guide explaining how someone can create a blog like his and mine using Hugo and Netlify CMS. You can view it [here](https://www.ragasirtahk.tk/2018/01/setting-up-netlify-cms-on-hugo/).


### And Yes, this blog deploys on Netlify!
